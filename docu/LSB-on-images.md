# LSB on images 

This explanation is based on [this article](https://medium.com/swlh/lsb-image-steganography-using-python-2bbbee2c69a2).

This document doesn't pretend to be a through explanation on Least Significant Bit (LSB) steganography method. Just some notes to grasp the concept.

## LSB IMAGE STEGANOGRAPHY

> LSB Steganography is an image steganography technique in which messages are hidden inside an image by replacing each pixelâ€™s least significant bit with the bits of the message to be hidden.

During the project we will use 2 kinds of it:

1. Text encoding: Use the LSB to encode ours ASCII chars
2. Image encoding: Use one of the layers to hide a black & white image. (for instance a QR code).
