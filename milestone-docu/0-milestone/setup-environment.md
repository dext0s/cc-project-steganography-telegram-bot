# Setup Development Environment

This document is right now a brief summary on the development environment used. It should be OS agnostic.
## IDE

I'll be using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), you can find an installation tutorial on their website.

## Code language

The majority of the logic of the project will be written in Python.
You might need to [install an interpreter](https://www.python.org/downloads/) dependig on your OS.
Proper management of package dependence will be set on the following milestones.

As for code guidelines I'll be following [PEP-8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) and [PEP-257](https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/).
